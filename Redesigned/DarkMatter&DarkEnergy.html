They make up the majority of the universe, with dark matter accounting for approximately 25%, dark energy for about 69%, and visible matter comprising only a small fraction of 5%.</section><section class=fade-in-out id=dark-matter><h2>Dark Matter</h2><p>Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation but exerts a gravitational pull on normal matter. Scientists infer its existence from its effects on the motion and structure of galaxies and galaxy clusters.<p>One of the compelling pieces of evidence for dark matter comes from the observation of galaxy rotation curves. In spiral galaxies, stars and gas in the outer regions rotate at unexpectedly high speeds, indicating the presence of additional mass that cannot be accounted for by visible matter. This unseen mass is believed to be dark matter, forming a halo around galaxies and providing the gravitational force necessary to explain the observed motions.<p>Another line of evidence comes from gravitational lensing, the bending of light by the gravitational field of massive objects. By studying the distortions in the paths of light from distant galaxies, scientists can infer the distribution of mass in the universe.<p>Dark matter is estimated to constitute about 25% of the universe, making it a significant component. However, its true nature and composition remain unknown. Scientists have proposed various particle candidates for dark matter, such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or axions, but direct detection of these particles has proved challenging.</section><section class=fade-in-out id=dark-energy><h2>Dark Energy</h2><p>Dark energy makes up approximately 69% of the universe and is a mysterious force that causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate over time, rather than slow down due to gravity. Scientists discovered its existence in the late 1990s by observing distant supernovae, which appeared fainter than expected, indicating that they were farther away than predicted by the standard model of cosmology.<p>The nature of dark energy is still unknown, but there are several possible explanations. One theory suggests that it is a property of space itself, as proposed by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity. He introduced a term called the cosmological constant, which represents a constant energy density that fills space and counteracts gravity. Another possibility is that dark energy is a dynamic field that changes over time and space, such as quintessence or phantom energy. A third option is that dark energy is a sign of a flaw in our understanding of gravity, and that we need a new theory to describe it.</section><section class=fade-in-out id=current-research><h2>Current Research and Experiments</h2><p>Dark matter and dark energy are among the most active areas of research in astrophysics today. Scientists are trying to detect dark matter particles directly using underground detectors or indirectly using telescopes and satellites. They are also trying to measure the properties and evolution of dark energy using various methods, such as surveys of galaxy clusters, supernovae, and cosmic microwave background radiation.<p>Understanding dark matter and dark energy is crucial for unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos and expanding our knowledge of the fundamental nature of the universe. As research and experiments continue, we may one day uncover the true nature of these enigmatic entities and shed light on the hidden workings of the universe.</section><section class=fade-in-out id=conclusion><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Dark matter and dark energy play integral roles in shaping the universe. Dark matter's gravitational effects influence the formation of structures such as galaxies and galaxy clusters, while dark energy drives the accelerated expansion of the universe. Despite their elusive and invisible nature, scientists have made significant progress in understanding their existence and impact. Ongoing research and experiments offer hope for further insights into the true nature and properties of dark matter and dark energy, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the cosmos and its intricate workings.</section><footer><p style=color:#ddd;line-height:.8>References:<ul><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter>Dark Matter</a><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy>Dark Energy</a><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lensing>Gravitational Lensing</a><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particle>Weakly Interacting Massive Particles</a><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant>Cosmological Constant</a></ul><p style=line-height:.4>Designed and developed by: Dev Kothari<p>Page Created on: 13th July 2023</footer><script src="https://dev123456689.github.io/My-First-Webpage/Redesigned/Script.js?v=1.002"></script>
