It is thought to be about 13.8 billion years old, and it is still expanding. The universe is composed of a variety of objects, including stars, galaxies, planets, and moons.</section><section class="fade-in-out link"id=big-bang onclick='OP("http://127.0.0.1:3000/Redesigned/Big_Bang.html")'><h2>The Big Bang</h2><p>The Big Bang is the prevailing cosmological model for the universe. It states that the universe began as a very hot, dense point about 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding and cooling ever since.</section><section class="fade-in-out link"id=dark-matter-energy onclick='OP("http://127.0.0.1:3000/Redesigned/Dark_Matter_And_Dark_Energy.html")'><h2>Dark Matter and Dark Energy</h2><p>About 68% of the universe is made up of dark energy, which is a mysterious force that is causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. The remaining 27% of the universe is made up of dark matter, another mysterious substance that cannot be seen directly but whose gravitational effects can be observed.</section><section class="fade-in-out link"id=observable-universe onclick='OP("https://dev123456689.github.io/My-First-Webpage/TheObservableUniverse.html")'><h2>The Observable Universe</h2><p>The observable universe is the part of the universe that we can see. It is limited by the speed of light, which means that it takes light time to travel from distant objects to us. The observable universe is about 93 billion light-years in diameter.</section><section class="fade-in-out link"id=future-universe onclick='OP("https://dev123456689.github.io/My-First-Webpage/TheFutureUniverse.html")'><h2>The Future of the Universe</h2><p>The future of the universe is uncertain. It is possible that the universe will continue to expand forever, eventually becoming cold and dark. It is also possible that the expansion of the universe will slow down and eventually reverse, leading to a big crunch.</section><footer><p style=line-height:.8>.<p style=color:#ddd;line-height:.8>References:<ul><li href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe>The Universe<li href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang>The Big Bang<li href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter>Dark Matter<li href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy>Dark Energy<li href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe>The Observable Universe</ul><p style=line-height:.8>.<p style=color:#ddd;line-height:.4>Designed and developed by: Dev Kothari<p style=color:#ddd;line-height:1>Page Created on: 11th July 2023<p style=line-height:1>.</footer><script src="Script.min.js?v=1.002"></script>
