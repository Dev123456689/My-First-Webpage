It is a ball-shaped region of space that has a radius of about 13.8 billion light-years, the time it took for the electromagnetic radiation from the farthest objects to reach us. It contains at least 2 trillion galaxies, but it may not represent the whole universe, which could be infinite.</section><section class=fade-in-out id=Observable-vs-Whole-Universe><h2>Observable Universe VS Whole Universe</h2><p>The observable universe is different from the whole universe, which is the entire cosmic system of matter and energy that exists. The whole universe could be much larger than the observable universe, or even infinite in size. However, we cannot observe anything beyond the observable universe, because the light or other signals from those regions have not had enough time to reach us since the beginning of the cosmological expansion.</section><section class=fade-in-out id=Observable-vs-Visible-Universe><h2>Observable Universe VS Visible Universe</h2><p>The observable universe is also different from the visible universe, which is the part of the universe that we can see in visible light. The visible universe is smaller than the observable universe, because some regions of space are too far away for their visible light to reach us. However, we can detect other types of radiation from those regions, such as radio waves or microwaves. For example, the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) is the oldest light in the universe, emitted about 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when the universe became transparent to photons. The CMBR fills the entire observable universe, but it is not visible to our eyes.</section><section class=fade-in-out id=significance-limitations><h2>Significance and Limitations</h2><p>Studying the observable universe is of great importance to astronomers and cosmologists. By exploring its structure, composition, history, and evolution, scientists gain insights into the fundamental nature of the universe and its origins. Observations within the observable universe allow us to test and refine our theories and models related to the laws of physics and the behavior of matter and energy.<p>However, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of observing the observable universe. We are confined to a region centered around our location, and there are regions beyond our observational reach. The true extent and properties of the entire universe remain unknown, and we can only speculate about what lies beyond our observable horizon.</section><footer><p style=line-height:.8>.<p style=color:#ddd;line-height:.8>References:<ul><li><a href=https://science.nasa.gov/observable-universe>Observable Universe NASA</a><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe>Observable Universe Wikipedia</a><li><a href=https://www.britannica.com/topic/observable-universe>Observable Universe Britannica</a></ul><p style=line-height:.8>.<p style=color:#ddd;line-height:.4>Designed and developed by: Dev Kothari<p style=color:#ddd;line-height:1>Page Created on: 13th July 2023<p style=line-height:1>.</footer><script src="https://dev123456689.github.io/My-First-Webpage/Redesigned/Script.js?v=1.002"></script>
