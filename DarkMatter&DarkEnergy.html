			<h1>Dark Matter & Dark Energy</h1>
		</header>

		<section id="introduction" class="fade-in-out">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Dark matter and dark energy are two of the most mysterious and
				intriguing phenomena in modern cosmology. They make up the
				majority of the universe, with dark matter accounting for
				approximately 25%, dark energy for about 69%, and visible matter
				comprising only a small fraction of 5%.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="dark-matter" class="fade-in-out">
			<h2>Dark Matter</h2>
			<p>Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not
				interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation but
				exerts a gravitational pull on normal matter. Scientists infer
				its existence from its effects on the motion and structure of
				galaxies and galaxy clusters.</p>
			<p>One of the compelling pieces of evidence for dark matter comes
				from the observation of galaxy rotation curves. In spiral
				galaxies, stars and gas in the outer regions rotate at
				unexpectedly high speeds, indicating the presence of additional
				mass that cannot be accounted for by visible matter. This unseen
				mass is believed to be dark matter, forming a halo around
				galaxies and providing the gravitational force necessary to
				explain the observed motions.</p>
			<p>Another line of evidence comes from gravitational lensing, the
				bending of light by the gravitational field of massive objects.
				By studying the distortions in the paths of light from distant
				galaxies, scientists can infer the distribution of mass in the
				universe.</p>
			<p>Dark matter is estimated to constitute about 25% of the universe,
				making it a significant component. However, its true nature and
				composition remain unknown. Scientists have proposed various
				particle candidates for dark matter, such as weakly interacting
				massive particles (WIMPs) or axions, but direct detection of
				these particles has proved challenging.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="dark-energy" class="fade-in-out">
			<h2>Dark Energy</h2>
			<p>Dark energy makes up approximately 69% of the universe and is a mysterious
				force that causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate over time,
				rather than slow down due to gravity. Scientists discovered its existence in
				the late 1990s by observing distant supernovae, which appeared fainter than
				expected, indicating that they were farther away than predicted by the
				standard model of cosmology.</p>
			<p>The nature of dark energy is still unknown, but there are several possible
				explanations. One theory suggests that it is a property of space itself, as
				proposed by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity. He
				introduced a term called the cosmological constant, which represents a
				constant energy density that fills space and counteracts gravity. Another
				possibility is that dark energy is a dynamic field that changes over time
				and space, such as quintessence or phantom energy. A third option is that
				dark energy is a sign of a flaw in our understanding of gravity, and that we
				need a new theory to describe it.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="current-research" class="fade-in-out">
			<h2>Current Research and Experiments</h2>
			<p>Dark matter and dark energy are among the most active areas of research in
				astrophysics today. Scientists are trying to detect dark matter particles
				directly using underground detectors or indirectly using telescopes and
				satellites. They are also trying to measure the properties and evolution of
				dark energy using various methods, such as surveys of galaxy clusters,
				supernovae, and cosmic microwave background radiation.</p>
			<p>Understanding dark matter and dark energy is crucial for unraveling the
				mysteries of the cosmos and expanding our knowledge of the fundamental
				nature of the universe. As research and experiments continue, we may one day
				uncover the true nature of these enigmatic entities and shed light on the
				hidden workings of the universe.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="conclusion" class="fade-in-out">
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Dark matter and dark energy play integral roles in shaping the universe.
				Dark matter's gravitational effects influence the formation of structures
				such as galaxies and galaxy clusters, while dark energy drives the
				accelerated expansion of the universe. Despite their elusive and invisible
				nature, scientists have made significant progress in understanding their
				existence and impact. Ongoing research and experiments offer hope for
				further insights into the true nature and properties of dark matter and dark
				energy, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the cosmos and its
				intricate workings.</p>
